# FOUR

1. Start Screen
On start, four squares appear in the center of the screen. Upon tapping, the screen will zoom into the experience.
Once in the element, you cannot leave unless you refresh the page.

2. Element Screen
This screen has a unique background and four tappable rectangles.

Upon tapping a rectangle, an audio loop starts and the rectangle has a glow around its edges.
Tapping again turns off the audio and removes the glow.
